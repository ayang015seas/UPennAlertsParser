Dear Members of the Penn Community,

Penn Police were recently alerted to a series of burglaries that occurred along S. 40th Street between Pine Street and Baltimore Avenue, just south of our campus.

In several of these incidents, items were taken from residences for which doors or windows were unsecured.

The Division of Public Safety will continue to ensure the highest level of safety and security for our community. In addition, Penn Police and Allied will be increasing patrols in the off-campus area.

Public Safety encourages everyone to lock their outside doors and windows and report suspicious behavior to Penn Police at 215-573-3333.

Please be sure to use the Walking and Riding Escorts available to you free of charge. Additionally, if you have not done so, please take a moment to sign up for the UPennAlert Emergency Notification System as well as the Penn Guardian System which can help Police better find your location in an emergency.
