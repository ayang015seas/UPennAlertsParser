Dear Members of the Penn Community,

Penn Police have been investigating a series of thefts committed by a team =
of individuals who are systematically stealing unattended items throughout =
our campus, in secured and unsecured buildings.=20
Fortunately, Penn Police did make an arrest of the leader of this team on J=
une 20, and have recovered some of the stolen property.=20

This team often enters buildings by following someone else into a secured b=
uilding or knocking on a door and asking to be let in. Should you encounter=
 someone engaging in suspicious activity, do not confront them; call Penn P=
olice at 215-573-3333 or 5-1-1 from any campus phone.

Public Safety is continuing to work with Philadelphia and Drexel Police and=
 has additional uniform and plain-clothes officers working to identify the =
additional individuals. We ask that you be vigilant of such attempts and wi=
sh to remind you of our =E2=80=9COperation Building Safe=E2=80=9D Program a=
t Penn.=20

The main objective of =E2=80=9COperation Building Safe=E2=80=9D is to creat=
e a welcoming and safe environment for our Penn community and visitors, inc=
luding prospective students, parents, faculty and staff, by following the g=
uidelines below:
1.=09Securing perimeter access points with electronic access control or man=
ual locks.
2.=09Allowing accessibility to the Penn community during normal business ho=
urs.
3.=09Identifying a secure visitor entrance that creates a welcoming environ=
ment.

The =E2=80=9COperation Building Safe=E2=80=9D model is already working succ=
essfully in 75% of Penn buildings, reducing thefts in those buildings. This=
 program, however, will only be truly successful with your participation. I=
f you have any questions, please contact Public Safety at 215-573-3333 and =
remember to follow these safety tips:
=E2=80=9CSafety & Security is a Shared Responsibility=E2=80=9D

      Be sure that your UPennAlert information is up to date through these =
easy to follow directions.

.

      Report suspicious activity and behavior to the Penn Police by calling=
 215-573-3333 or by dialing =E2=80=9C511=E2=80=9D from any campus phone.
