Dear Members of the Penn Community:

As we begin a new academic year, we at the Division of Public Safety wish t=
o reiterate our support for a healthy and safe environment for you to study=
, work, research and live.

We all recognize that these are challenging times for our country, our city=
 and our University.  Between the continuing changes due to the COVID-19 pa=
ndemic as well as recent crime trends and civil unrest in Philadelphia, we =
understand that this may be an upsetting and uncertain time for the Penn an=
d University City communities. Be assured that the University considers you=
r safety its utmost priority and has consistently maintained the normally h=
igh levels of Penn Police and Allied Security patrols to ensure the physica=
l safety of our community. =20
=20
As you may be aware, at 9:30 pm on Tuesday night, August 25th,  a large gro=
up of people marched from Clark Park at 43rd & Baltimore Avenue to 40th and=
 Chestnut Street.  The group broke windows and painted graffiti along the 4=
0th Street corridor causing extensive damage to several businesses, Penn bu=
ildings and a Penn Police vehicle.  They also harassed University City neig=
hbors on their way back to Clark Park, where they eventually dispersed.  Pe=
nn Police and Allied Security were on site ensuring the physical safety of =
pedestrians and motorist in the area.
=20
The Penn Police continue to work closely with the Philadelphia Police depar=
tment, in order to receive information and support for any future potential=
ly concerning or violent events occurring close to our campus, and the off-=
campus student housing area.
=20
We encourage you to use all of the free services available to you and offer=
 the below reminders:
=20
*  Use Walking Escort to walk with you to any location between 30th Street =
and 43rd Streets, from Market Street to Baltimore Avenue 24/7; as well as w=
est to 50th Street and north into Powelton between 10 am =E2=80=93 3 am.
*  Use PennRides for free transportation to both the West Philadelphia and =
Center City areas.
*  For a medical emergency, call 215-573-3333 for the Alternative Response =
Unit (AR-1)  and Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT).
*  If you see something, say something. Report suspicious behavior immediat=
ely to Penn Police at 215-573-3333.
=20
Also, if you have not done so, please take a moment to sign up for the UPen=
nAlert System, as well as the Penn Guardian App which can help Public Safet=
y locate you in an emergency. Remember that after receiving a UPennAlert, y=
ou can find additional information about the on-going emergency on the Publ=
ic Safety website.  Our website becomes a =E2=80=9CBulletin Board=E2=80=9D =
with real time updates during an event or emergency, and is an excellent so=
urce of information to the entire Penn community and parents of students wh=
o are living in the University City area.
=20
Most importantly, take care of yourself, whether by talking to a friend, co=
lleague, family member or contacting Penn=E2=80=99s Counseling & Psychologi=
cal Services (CAPS)  or the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). You can also=
 call Special Services at 215-898-6600 or the 24/7 Help Line.  Remember Pen=
n has a student Medical Amnesty  program that ensures students can request =
medical assistance for themselves or their friends.=20
=20
The Division of Public Safety Team is wishing you a safe and productive sem=
ester!=20
